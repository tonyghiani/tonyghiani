## Hi there! I'm Marco Antonio, but just Marco is fine, or Tony if you prefer! ðŸ˜‰

I'm a Software Engineer and Instructor, and I've loved coding since I still was a 13 years old kid with no beard at all!
I taught +100 students on the basics of Computer Science and advanced JavaScript, always trying to transmit the same passion. As many others like me, I discovered teaching is the real way to learn something, and I built my teaching style on it, trying to transform every abstraction into concrete real-life examples. 

I like to spend my coding time experimenting, finding new algorithms or practices which I can lately apply to my projects. I have a particular love for performing code, always aiming to find a faster snippet that still makes the code readable for humans.

During my studies, I worked with different programming languages such as C, Java and Python, but **I currently write most of my code in JavaScript and React.js, including creating some APIs with Node.js!**

When I'm not coding I like to write tech blog posts for the community, sharing the little I know of the immense ocean of CS. If you like to read some post and discuss them, I'll be more than happy to speak with you ðŸ˜„

**Here you can find some of them from my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@marcoantonio.ghiani01):**

When I'm not coding I love to spend time with my family and friends, going out and doing social sports (playing beach volley at Barcelona's beach is a must!), dedicating also some time to reading when I'm chilling at home.

If you have any further questions or just want to have a chat, feel free to send me a tweet or DM!
